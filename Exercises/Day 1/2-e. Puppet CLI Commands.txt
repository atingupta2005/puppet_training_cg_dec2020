## Configuration
 - Using the puppet config command we can view and set configuration parameters including the path to the manifest
 - If the manifest is a directory then each manifest is processed in alphanumeric order
# Print settings from Puppet.confg file as well as the defaults
puppet config print
puppet config print config
puppet config print manifest

#To specify which section from config file to print and also which environment
puppet config print manifest --section master --environment production

## Manifest Files
 - The puppet agent can apply local manifests by specifying the path
 - If the path is a directory all manifests are processed
 - If the agent connects to the server the agent the manifests are located by the settings of the server

#site.pp is the default/main file
vim /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp
notify {'Hello World':
	message => "Hello World!",
}

#To apply locally by specifying the path to manifest file
puppet apply /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp

#To get from the puppet server
puppet agent -t

## Agent Run
 - Be default the agent runs every 30 minutes. We can force a run from the CLI.
puppet config print runinterval
expr 1800 / 60
puppet agent -t

#Notice: Hello World!

## Working with Default Environments
cdpp
vim 01.pp
notify {'Hello World':
	message => "Hello World!",
}

puppet apply 01.pp
puppet agent -t

vim 02.pp
notify {'Hello World 2':
	message => "Hello World 2!",
}

puppet agent -t

puppet config print runinterval
expr 1800 / 60
systemctl status puppet

## Create New Environments
 - By default all agents work in the production environment
 - We can create more environments on the Puppet server and configure agents to use them
mkdir -p /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/dev/manifests
tree /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments
clear
#When our agent runs, it will request for settings from dev environment
puppet config set environment dev --section=agent
puppet agent -t

#Swtich back
puppet config set environment production --section=agent
puppet agent -t


## BASH Aliases
 - We may often move to the manifest directory
 - We can create an alias to make this easier
alias cdpp="cd $(puppet config print manifest)"
alias
vim ~/.bashrc #add the line to bottom of file
alias cdpp="cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests"
unalias cdpp
source ~/.bashrc
alias ; cdpp; pwd

# Resources
 - Resources are the main building block of Puppet:
	- notify resource with Hello World
	- package resource to ensure chrony was installed
	- service resource to ensure chronyd was running
 - Puppet is declarative, meaning it states what it want done not how to do it
 - On CentOS the packaging will be done with dnf/yum, on Ubuntu with apt and Windows with chocolatly.

## List Resources and Help
 - The first command list all resource types. We can gain help on a type with describe and we can print the example configuration from a resource.

puppet resource --type
puppet describe service
puppet resource service {

d
#service should show as running and enabled

puppet resource service atd
#If at is not installed on my system so should show as stopped and disabled

# Extending Manifests Into Modules
 - We started off with a quick look at installing the Apache Web Server with a downloaded module. We now look more at modules and creating our own
## Modules
 - Modules are great ways to encapsulate code in to reusable lumps. Puppet forge is a great resource for modules that have been shared. The stdlib from puppetlabs is always useful
puppet module list
puppet module install puppetlabs/stdlib
puppet module uninstall puppetlabs/stdlib --force
#To install modules in a shared environment so that it can be used in any environment
#Installing in a shared module directory makes it available across environments
puppet module install -i /etc/puppetlabs/code/modules puppetlabs/stdlib

#Examples
cat /etc/puppetlabs/code/modules/stdlib/examples/file_line.pp

## Example Manifest From Module
 - A puppet manifest will have the extension .pp and contains code to be run on agents. We can use puppet apply to execute local manifests
cp /etc/puppetlabs/code/modules/stdlib/examples/file_line.pp ~/
puppet apply file_line.pp
cat /tmp/dansfile

## File Edits Using file_line Resource
 - Rather than deliver a complete file we can edit the file with file_line. The file_line resource that ships with the puppetlabs/stdlib module and shares the same top level namespace. We can easily replace or add lines

#Example Module (Require tag):
service { 'sshd':
	ensure => 'running',
	enable => true,
}
file_line { 'root_login_ssh':
	path => '/etc/ssh/sshd_config',
	ensure => 'present',
	line => 'PermitRootLogin no',
	match => '^PermitRootLogin',
	notify => Service['sshd'],
}



# The BIG Three
 - The 3 big resources are:
	• Package
	• Service
	• File
 - Many tasks can be managed using	these resources

## Organize Code On Server
 - Creating or own modules will help us reuse and orgainize code on the server. 
 - Modules can be shared or created within an environment
 - We only have the production environment so we will use that

## Creating The Module Structure
 - A simple module can be created at the command line in the correct environment
cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules
mkdir -p chrony/{manifests,files,examples}
tree chrony

##The Module Manifest
 - The main manifest in a module should be init.pp
 - It is called by the module name only
 - The code within module manifest make up a class definition
 - Here we make sure the package is installed
vim chrony/manifests/init.pp
class chrony {
	package { 'chrony':
	ensure => 'installed',
}
}

puppet agent -t

##Service
 - Using the service resource we can ensure the service is running and auto-starts
 - We can also enforce the correct order the resources are applied
vim chrony/manifests/init.pp
class chrony {
	package { 'chrony':
	ensure => 'installed',
}
service { 'chronyd':
	ensure => 'running',
	enable => true,
	require => Package['chrony'],
}
}

puppet agent -t

# Restart Service when File Changes
 - We can use notify event to ensure a service is restarted if a file changes
 - Adding the new file to the chrony/files/ directory ensures that the Puppet file server can deliver the file
 cp /etc/chrony.conf /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/chrony/files/chrony.conf
 
 #Do some changes in the file
 vim /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/chrony/files/chrony.conf

## init.pp
 - The default manifest of a module should be called init.pp
 - Notice the delivery of the file and the path used
cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules
vim chrony/manifests/init.pp
class chrony {
	package { 'chrony':
	ensure => 'installed',
}
service { 'chronyd':
	ensure => 'running',
	enable => true,
	require => Package['chrony'],
}
file { '/etc/chrony.conf':
	ensure => file,
	content => file('chrony/chrony.conf'),
	notify => Service['chronyd'],
}
}

#Confirm changes in the file
cat /etc/chrony.conf

## Including Modules in Manifests
 - We can return to our manifests and perhaps remove the message and add in the include statement to make sure that both apache and chrony modules are delivered.
 
cdpp
rm 02.pp

vim 01.pp
include chrony

puppet agent -t

rm /etc/chrony.conf

puppet agent -t

## Using Conditionals
 - Conditional statement can help tune the manifest.
 - These can be based on facts. Facts can be printed and researched with facter
cdpp
vim 01.pp
if $osfamily == 'RedHat' {
	include chrony
}
facter --show-legacy | grep osfamily

puppet agent -t

vim 01.pp
if $osfamily == 'Ubuntu' {
	include chrony
}

puppet agent -t


# Creating Modules
cdpp

#Move ssh.pp to server
mv ssh.pp /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/

puppet agent -t

cdpp

ls

rm 02.pp

cd ../modules

ls

#Create module
mkdir -p chrony/manifests; mkdir -p chrony/files


puppet resource package chrony > chrony/manifests/init.pp
puppet resource service chronyd >> chrony/manifests/init.pp

vim chrony/manifests/init.pp
class
{
	package { 'chrony':
	  ensure   => 'installed',
	}
	service { 'chronyd':
	  ensure   => 'running',
	  enable   => 'true',
	  require  => Package['chrony'],
	}
	file_line { '/etc/chrony.conf':
		ensure	=> 'file',
		content	=> file('chrony/chrony.conf'),
		notify	=> Service['chronyd'],
	}
}

puppet module list

cdpp
rm 01.pp
vim 01.pp
include apache
include chrony

cat /etc/chrony.conf
puppet agent -t
cat /etc/chrony.conf

# Using Conditional Statements
facter
facter --puppet
facter --puppet --show lagecy	# Different ways of displaying information
facter --puppet --show lagecy | grep osfamily
vim 01.pp
include apache
if $osfamily == 'RedHat' {
	include chrony
}

rm /etc/chrony.conf
puppet agent -t

# Change condition to make sure its working
vim 01.pp
include apache
if $osfamily == 'Ubuntu' {
	include chrony
}
rm /etc/chrony.conf
puppet agent -t
